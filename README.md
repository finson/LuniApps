# LuniApps
Standalone (Arduino-only, no Firmata, no remote client) applications built with the Luni device driver library.

The Luni library is a tool for writing device drivers that run on an Arduino.  It is possible to use the device drivers standalone,
or with a remote client via Firmata.  This LuniApps repo contains a number of standalone Arduino programs.
